      <img src="assets/images/HeadShot.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Heather Gowton">

      <p>Imagination is innate within all of us. Indulge it, express it, fuel it! For what wants to living a world without creativity?</p>

      <p>Helping people has always been one of my biggest passions. First in Girl Scouts and leading into becoming a teacher. I never would have guessed by life would lead me into coding. In fact I rememeber adamantly HATING everything to do with the computer throughout my grade school and even college years. It wasn't until getting a teaching job at a cyber charter school in Pennsylvania, that I really started to see how important technology is to my passion. After developing 5 online curriculums in Moodle and being an online science teacher for 9 years I realized my talents could be used to help the entire school. At that time I transitioned into Instructional Systems Design, at the same online charter school where I had been teaching.</p>

      <p>Life has again thrown some unpredicted curve balls straight at my head. Causing me to shift focus once again. I have enrolled in UPenn's Full Stack Web Development BootCamp to help me with the next phase.</p>
